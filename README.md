# Data Structures and Algorithms

Here I implement various data structures and algorithms as a means of gaining hands-on experience with said topics. All code is housed in the `dsalgs` package and demonstrated in the Jupyter notebooks in the parent directory. I also use this opportunity to learn `pytest`, which runs the tests in the `tests` directory.

I've also written a `Timer` object that times the basic operations on data structures (`insert`, `search`, etc.) and displays the results.
